### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a passionate Software Engineer currently weaving code magic at Phaistos Networks. My journey in the tech world has been nothing short of exciting, with a profound love for programming leading the way.

ðŸ”§ What I Do: At the heart of my projects, you'll find a compiler for the C language that I'm currently developing. This endeavor is not just about building a tool; it's about understanding the essence of programming languages and how they empower us to create. You will also find a kernel with a custom file system and a text editor. All created in C,C++ and x86 asm

ðŸš€ My Experience: My adventure in tech has taken me through the intricate realms of operating systems and the robust frameworks of Java and Spring Boot. Each line of code I write is a step towards mastering the art and science of software engineering.

ðŸ’» Favorite Languages & Technologies: I have a special place in my heart for Java, JavaScript, and C/C++. These languages and frameworks are my go-to tools for crafting efficient, robust, and scalable solutions. They resonate with my creative and analytical sides, allowing me to push the limits of what I can achieve in software development.

ðŸ’¡ Looking Forward: I am always on the lookout for innovative ideas and collaborations that push the boundaries of what's possible. Whether it's optimizing algorithms, exploring new technologies, or contributing to open-source projects, I'm all in.

Let's connect! Whether you're interested in discussing technology, seeking advice, or collaborating on a project, I'm just a message away. Together, let's code the future.
